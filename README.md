Summary of Fisher's Iris Dataset:
The Fisher's Iris dataset or the Iris dataset is a dataset which was introduced by the renowned statistician and geneticist Sir Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminate analysis. This multivariate dataset was used to develop and evaluate a linear function which differentiated the three species of Iris, *Iris Versicolor, Iris Virginica and Iris Setosa*, based on the morphology of their flowers. While there is a slight overlap in morphology of the  *versicolor and virginica* species, the *setosa* specie is very noticably different and perhaps we will get to see this in the manipulation of the data for this project.It should be noted that while Fisher used this dataset in his paper, it was his colleague Dr. Edgar Anderson who actually collected and compiled the data. Anderson was a botanist and collected the majority of this data at the Gaspe Peninsula in Canada, Fisher obtained his permission to use the Dataset from Anderson while they worked together in Britain from 1929. The dataset includes the sepal length (Sepal are modified leaves which encase the developing flower and can be green/leaflike or composed of petal like tissue. In the case of the Iris' they are beautiful petal like features), sepal width, petal length and petal width of the three species of Irish mentioned above, these parameters have been measured and recorded in centimetres.
